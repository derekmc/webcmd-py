  <h1> Cookie Jar</h1>
  <h3> Intro</h3>
  <p>
    Cookie Jar is a "semi-distributed" digital currency system with related tools.

  </p>
  <h3>Semi-Distributed </h3>
  <p>
    Cookie Jar uses a centrally hosted server/service provider, but has a decentralized backup protocol.
    A community can audit the central service provider(by confirming backup records) or replace them
    if they go down or are compromised.
  </p>
  <h3> Anonymized Backups </h3>
  <p>
    Backups are anonymized using hashes.  User accounts are split into distinct records, for each currency type,
    and even individual account balances are split into separate records to obfuscate balances.  Records are split
    probabilistically to conform to Benford's law, or some other similar pattern to reduce "chain analysis."
    Existing records may be randomly split to keep a stable amount of "churn" to similarly reduce possible
    analysis.  The following is a preliminary scheme to help anonymize this backup information.

Example Account Backup:
  Account Balance: 1,234,567 Green Beans

  Hashes:
    User Site Hash: hash(originating_site_id + user_root_cookie)
    User Backup Hash: hash(backup_version + user_site_hash) // used to claim account
    Record Hash: hash(user_backup_hash + record_id)

  Records:
    Record (id=1, hash=KZRD):    22,691 Green Beans
    Record (id=2, hash=TEVJ):   264,393 Green Beans
    Record (id=3, hash=XSTD):   931,772 Green Beans
    Record (id=4, hash=ZDEP):    15,711 Green Beans
